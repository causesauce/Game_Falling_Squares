# Game_Falling_Squares
 At the top of the panel, in random places, there appear squares which then fall down. The player has to eliminate them by clicking on them before they reach the bottom edge of the panel. Squares clicked and those reaching the bottom edge disappear. The current score is constantly shown on the label â€” this is the fraction, in per cents, of the number of squares which have not reached the bottom relative to the total number of squares created.  After a prescribed time, the game is over: squares stop falling, new ones are not created any more and an appropriate message is shown (as in the image above). The player wins if the fraction displayed on the label is still higher than a prescribed value.
